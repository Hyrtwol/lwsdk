                        This document describes the changes&nbsp;made to&nbsp;the LWSC file format that 
                        bring it to version 4 (LightWave®&nbsp;9.2 and later).</p>
                    <p><strong>Baked Object Identifiers</strong></p>
                    <p>In releases prior to LightWave® 9.2, objects loaded into a scene were 
                        dynamically assigned identifiers based upon their load order each time the 
                        scene was loaded.&nbsp; In cases where third-party plug-ins had cached these 
                        fluid identifiers, issues could result&nbsp;when objects were deleted from the 
                        scene, or when the load order of objects was altered manually (by direct 
                        editing of the scene file).&nbsp; Objects would receive new 
                        identifiers&nbsp;the next time the scene was loaded, and the plug-in could be 
                        left with an invalid reference (often breaking the scene).&nbsp; Staring with 
                        LightWave® 9.2, scene objects (Cameras, Lights, Bones, etc.) are all now 
                        assigned identifiers that can be considered "unique" within the domain of the 
                        scene, and permanent as long as the object remains a member of a particular 
                        scene domain.</p>
                    <p>
                    These new assigned (or "baked") identifiers appear on the line in the scene file where the 
                    object is declared, e.g.:<p>
                        <table border="0">
                            <tr>
                                <td width="30"></td>
                                <td><code>AddNullObject <strong>10000000</strong> Null</code></td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td width="30"></td>
                                <td><code>AddBone <strong>40020000</strong></code></td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td width="30"></td>
                                <td><code>LoadObjectLayer 1 <strong>10000003</strong> G:box.lwo</code></td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td width="30"></td>
                                <td><code>AddCamera <strong>30000000</strong></code></td>
                            </tr>
                        </table>
                    </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>Once "baked", these permanent identifiers are saved into the scene 
                        file along with the object, and are&nbsp;re-assigned to the object whenever the 
                        scene is loaded again.&nbsp; New objects added to the scene are assigned new 
                        identifiers which are "baked" onto them and remain theirs while they exist in 
                        the scene.&nbsp; When objects are deleted from the scene, all remaining objects 
                        retain their previously assigned identifiers, and the identifier of the object 
                        deleted from the scene becomes available for re-assignment to the next new 
                        object added.</p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Re-formated Goal</strong></p>
                    <p>The numeric format of the GoalObject entry has been changed to hexidecimal.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
