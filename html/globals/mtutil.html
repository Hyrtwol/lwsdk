    <br><b>Mutex-only Functions</b>
    <p>The multithreading global supplies a mutex (mutual exclusion) mechanism for managing
    threaded execution of your plug-in. LightWave&reg; may invoke your plug-in from multiple
    threads simultaneously, which has the effect of threading your code. But when doing
    certain things, for example when reading and writing global data, the threads of your code
    should be executed one at a time, rather than all at once. The mutex mechanism is a way
    for the threads of your code to cooperate in waiting for one another.</p>
    <p>Think of a mutex as a dressing room, a place where a thread can have some privacy. Any
    time your plug-in needs to do something synchronously (one thread at a time), you ask to
    be let into the dressing room by calling <tt>lock</tt>. If another thread (another
    &quot;you&quot;) is already in that dressing room, your thread waits until the other
    thread is done. Then your thread gets the dressing room, and other threads that want that
    dressing room must wait for you to finish. When you're finished, you call <tt>unlock</tt>.</p>
    <p>The LWMTUtilID returned by the <tt>create</tt> function allows you to use up to 129
    separate mutexes. These are organized as one thread lock, numbered 0, and 128 generic
    locks numbered 1 to 128. The distinction is purely for organizational reasons. There is
    no functional difference between the locks. The number of the lock is passed as the second
    argument to <tt>lock</tt> and <tt>unlock</tt>. You might think of these as 129 different
    dressing rooms.</p>
    <p>Multithreading is a complex topic. If you're unfamiliar with it, you're encouraged to
    seek out a general programming text that discusses the writing of thread-safe code.</p>

    These "Mutex-only" functions are maintained in the Multithreading Utilities Global only
    for backward compatibility with existing plug-ins.  They are officially deprecated, and
    will be removed in some later release of LightWave&reg;.

      <dd>Blocks until the mutex becomes available. Returns true if successful, or false if the
        lock couldn't be executed for some reason. The index is an integer from 0 to 128 that
        identifies which of the 129 mutexes to lock. If another thread has already called <tt>lock</tt>
        for this mutex, the calling thread waits until the other thread calls <tt>unlock</tt>.</dd>

      <br>
      <dt><tt>ok = <strong>unlock</strong>( mtid, index )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Release the mutex. If another thread has been waiting for this mutex, that thread will
        execute. Returns true if successful, otherwise false.</dd>
    </dl>

    <br><b>Thread Group Functions</b>
    <p>Cross-platform threading support is provided by the functions in the following 
    sections. Threads are powerful tools for the developer that allow simultaneous 
    paths of execution to exist within the same application. On single-core, 
    single-processor systems, threads typically execute synchronously. However, on 
    multi-processor (or multi-core) systems, threads will often execute in true 
    parallel, allowing the application to be more responsive than would be allowed 
    by a single-path execution model.<br><br>

    These functions only provide the <i>mechanism</i> 
    for multi-threading. What you do within the threads you create is entirely your 
    concern. The responsibility lies with you, the developer, to ensure that the 
    functions you call from within your thread that lead to paths outside your 
    thread are safe to be called in that fashion (i.e., "thread-safe"). The 
    practice of calling LightWave&reg; Plug-In API functions from within a thread
    <i><b>is not officially supported</b></i>.  Please be aware that such a practice
    is undertaken by you at your own risk.

      <dd>Threads in LightWave&reg; are contained in, and managed by, "thread groups".  Each

      of threads to be managed provided in <tt>count</tt>.</dd>

      <br>
      <dt><tt><strong>groupDestroy</strong>( mtgrpid )</tt></dt>

      <br>
      <dt><tt>result = <strong>groupLockMutex</strong>( mtgrpid, mutex )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Attempts to gain a lock on the group's indicated mutex.  Groups contain
      129 mutexes, numbered from 0 to 128.  The call will block until the mutex is locked.</dd>

      <br>
      <dt><tt>result = <strong>groupUnlockMutex</strong>( mtgrpid, mutex )</tt></dt>

      <dt><tt>thrdid = <strong>groupAddThread</strong>( mtgrpid, func, argsize, argvalue )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Thread functions are added to the thread group using this function.  The function
      to be added must match the <tt>LWMTThreadFunc</tt> signature.  Each thread must accept
      a single <tt>void *</tt> argument, which is a pointer to the thread argument data
      <tt>argvalue</tt>.
      <p>
      This thread argument can be specified by the <tt>argvalue</tt> parameter.  If <tt>argsize</tt>
      is greater than zero (i.e., it specifies the size of the data pointed to by
      <tt>argvalue</tt>), then the value pointed to by <tt>argvalue</tt> will be passed to the
      thread fuction by value (a copy is made).  On the other hand, if <tt>argsize</tt> is
      zero, then <tt>argvalue</tt> will be passed to the thread function by reference (i.e.,
      the actual pointer will be provided).
      <p>
      As threads are added to the group, they are maintained in a suspended state.  Threads
      do not start until the group launches them with one of the execution functions (see

      <br>
      <dt><tt>result = <strong>groupRun</strong>( mtgrpid )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Causes the threads managed by the group to leave their suspended state, and begin
      execution (simultaneously).  This function blocks until all threads complete their
      processing (i.e., terminate).  Returns 1 upon success, and 0 if there was an error.</dd>

      <br>
      <dt><tt>result = <strong>groupBegin</strong>( mtgrpid )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Causes the threads managed by the group to leave their suspended state, and begin
      execution (simultaneously).  This function does not block, returning after all threads
      are started (or an error occurs).  Returns 1 upon success, and 0 if there was an error.</dd>

      <br>
      <dt><tt><strong>groupSync</strong>( mtgrpid )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Once started by <tt>groupBegin</tt>, this function will block the calling process
      until all active threads in the group complete.  Calling <tt>groupBegin</tt> followed
      immediately by <tt>groupSync</tt> is therefore functionally equivalent to a single
      call to <tt>groupRun</tt>.</dd>

      <br>
      <dt><tt><strong>groupAbort</strong>( mtgrpid )</tt></dt>
      <dd>This function signals to all active threads in the group that it is time to stop.

      <dt><tt><strong>groupKill</strong>( mtgrpid )</tt></dt>

      <dd>This function allows the current or identified thread to check for an abort

      <br>
      <dt><tt><strong>threadSleep</strong>( timeout )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Causes the thread to "sleep" for a specified number of milliseconds.  In most

      <br>
      <dt><tt><strong>rwlockReadLock</strong>( rwlock )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Obtain a read lock. The call will block if there is a write lock. A thread
      can have multiple read locks on the same rwlock. Each read lock must be unlocked.
      If a thread holds a write lock, it can obtain a read lock, but it will be treated
      as another write lock. Note that read locks can not be upgraded to a write lock.</dd>

      <dt><tt><strong>rwlockReadLockTimeout</strong>( rwlock, spintries )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Attempts to obtain a read lock, with a timeout if no read lock can be obtained.
      The timeout uses a spin lock. The maximum number of attempts to get a read lock is given
      by <tt>spintries</tt>. The first few attempts will be made without any waiting between
      tries. Subsequent attempts may sleep for a short period, under the assumption that the

      <dd>Releases a write lock. Each write lock obtained must be released, if not downgraded to
      a read lock.</dd>

      <br>
      <dt><tt><strong>rwlockWriteToReadLock</strong>( rwlock )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Downgrades a write lock to a read lock. The thread will keep a lock throughout the conversion.
      This allows a thread to safely switch from writing to reading without another thread
      intervening with a new write lock. Note that once converted to a read lock, it can not be
      upgraded to a write lock.</dd>


    <br><b>History</b>
    <p>LightWave&reg; 9.0 introduced the <strong>Thread Group</strong> and <strong>Thread</strong>
    support functions.</p>
    <p>LightWave&reg; 9.5 added read/write locks.</p>

    <p><strong>Mutex-only Example (legacy)</strong></p>
    <p>This code fragment outlines the sequence of steps you'd take to use a mutex.</p>
<pre>   #include &lt;lwmtutil.h&gt;

   LWMTUtilFuncs *mtutil;
   LWMTUtilID mtid;

   mtutil = global( LWMTUTILFUNCS_GLOBAL, GFUSE_TRANSIENT );
   if ( !mtutil )
      ...global not available, do this some other way...

   /* create the mutex */
   mtid = mtutil-&gt;create();
   ...

   /* enclose critical code (code that must run synchronously) in
      matching lock()/unlock() calls */
   if ( mtutil-&gt;lock( mtid, 0 )) {
      ...do something that can't be threaded...
      mtutil-&gt;unlock( mtid, 0 );
   }
   ...

   /* free the mutex when you no longer need it */
   if ( mtid ) mtutil-&gt;destroy( mtid );
</pre>
    <p><strong>Mutex-only Example</strong></p>
    <p>This code fragment illustrates the use of Thread Group functions for
