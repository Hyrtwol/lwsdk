  Modeler LScript can now use LW Panels if it is installed.  If it is
  not, then LScript will revert to the built-in Modeler requester
  interface, substituting as best it can equivalent controls for those
  provided by Panels.

  Use of Panels in Modeler LScript is not automatic.  The reqbegin()
  function has been altered to accomodate this.  If you employ reqbegin()
  in its original form, then LScript will use the built-in Modeler
  requester.

  However, you can now provide an optional second boolean parameter
  that instructs LScript to use the LW Panels plug-in instead if it
  is available.  A boolean return value is now provided by reqbegin()
  to indicate the presence (true) or absence (false) of the plug-in.

  A new requester control function has been added.  This function,
  ctlimage(), allow you to embed Targa Image Files (type 2 and 10,
  top-down or bottom-up raster) anywhere on your Panels-based
  requester panel.  ctlimage() takes one required and three optional
  parameters:  the image file name, the image's X (horizontal) offset,
  the image's Y (vertical) offset, and a color transparency mask -- as
  a single integer or a vector -- for simple color filtering (which
  can, in some cases, greatly increase display speed).
  
  You can also use the ctlposition() function to position your
  image anywhere on your panel.  You can use ctlposition() with
  a ctlimage() control without triggering LScript's control
  position release logic.

  Due to a design flaw in the plug-in API, plug-ins that load data in from
  a scene file can exceed the boundaries of their saved data, even to the
  point of reaching the end of the scene file.  Unfortunately, Layout
  mistakenly shares the scene file pointer with the plug-in (instead of
  correctly making a separate copy), so when a plug-in that has read beyond
  its data returns control to Layout, the scene can either become corrupted,
  or Layout may simply load nothing more (because its scene file pointer has
  hit EOF).
  
  The LScript Layout read() function has been bullet-proofed against this.
  It will now detect the end of a plug-in's data chunk (indicated in the
  scene file by the marker "EndPlugin"), and will set the EOF flag for
  any remaining data read()'s, thus preventing the script from reading any
  scene data that it does not own.

  Those identifiers used for variables and function names can now be
  "constructed" at run-time using a new language extension.  This extension
  is triggered by using a "tick" mark or reverse apostrophe (`) found on the
  same key as the tilde.
  
  Starting with a base identifier, you add constructors to the end,
  preceding each with the "tick" mark.  For example, the following
  code fragment will assign the integer value 15 to the identifier
  "Bob36Hood":

         . . .
         x = 36;
         y = "Hood";
         Bob`x`y = 15;
         . . .

  When this code is executed, 'x' will contain 36, 'y' will hold "Hood",
  'Bob' will be nil (ultimately, we are not assigning to 'Bob'), and
  the new variable 'Bob36Hood' will be 15.

  Pseudo-arrays can be constructed by using this run-time identifier
  construction.  However, this should only be used for low-count
  situations; otherwise, you should employ LScript's integral array
  support:

        . . .
        for(x = 1;x <= 10;x++)
            value`x = x * x;
        . . .

  You can also use this mechanism to build function names (for
  invocation, NOT for definition):

        . . .
        reqbegin("Testing Identifier Construction");
        c1 = ctlchoice("Which action?",1,
                       @"Action1","Action2","Action3"@);

        if(!reqpost()) return;

        x = getvalue(c1);
        reqend();

        func`x();  // evaluates to 'func1', 'func2' or 'func3'

  A requester function has been added to allow controls to be grouped
  together around a "leader" control.  When grouped using the ctlgroup()
  function, all subordinate controls are then positioned *relative* to the
  group leader.  The first argument is the control id of the group leader,
  while all subsequent arguments are the controls that belong to the group.
  Groupings should be established PRIOR to setting control positions.
  
  For instance, this function "attaches" a separator to a tab control:

       . . .
       c0 = ctltab("Tab1","Tab2","Tab3");
       c1 = ctlsep();

       ctlgroup(c0,c1);        // <-- c0 is group leader

       ctlposition(c1,0,24);   // <-- relative to c0
       ctlposition(c0,0,10);   // <-- group "leader" -- c1 will follow
       . . .

  Groupings can also be nested:

       . . .
       if(!reqbegin("Panels Test",true))
           return;

       c0 = ctlcheckbox("Testing Number 1",true);
       c1 = ctlcheckbox("Testing Number 2",false);
       c2 = ctlcheckbox("Testing Number 3",true);

  Because of the way the angle() function performs it calculations, returned
  angles, although accurate, would sometimes not match expectations.  With
  any angle measurement, there are always two possible values, the sum of
  which total to 360 degrees.  The angle() calculation logic will
  occasionally return one value when the script writer is expecting the
  other remainder.

  To avoid such confusion, the angle() function has been altered to always
  return the smaller of the two angle measurements -- which means that no
  returned angle will be greater than 180 degrees.  As before, you can get
  the inverse (or remainder) angle by subtracting the returned angle from
  360 degrees.

  A new feature has been added to the LScript requester mechanism.  Using
  a new function, ctlactive(), one or more requester controls can be
  activated and deactivated based upon the state of another control.
  This mechanism is by far the most complex of those yet created for the
  LScript requester.  It has a parameter structure much like ctlgroup(),
  however each call to ctlactive() must be companioned by an LScript
  callback UDF.

  The function parameters consist of the "state" control identifier as the
  first parameter (much like the group "leader" control for ctlgroup()):

    . . .
    c0 = ctlcheckbox("Testing Number 1",true);
    c1 = ctlinteger("Disperal Range",x);
    . . .
    ctlactive(c0,...       // 'c0' is the "state" control
    . . .

  The second parameter to ctlactive() is a character string that identifies
  a UDF in the current script:

    . . .
    ctlactive(c0,"toggleOn",...
    . . .

  All remaining parameters to ctlactive() are the identifiers of those controls
  whose state will be effected:

    . . .
    ctlactive(c0,"toggleOn",c1);
    . . .

  Active callbacks must accept a single argument that will hold the value of
  the "state" control at the time its state changed:

        . . .
        ctlactive(c0,"toggleOn",c1);
    . . .
    toggleOn: value
    {
        . . .
    }

  Callback UDFs must return a boolean true or false to indicate the active
  state of all governed controls.  A boolean true will cause governed controls
  to be active, while a false value will render them inactive.

  It is the script's responsibility to evalute the data passed to the
  callback UDF to determine the appropriate return value.  For instance,
  in the above code snippets, the "state" control is a checkbox.
  Therefore, the value passed to our callback UDF toggleOn() will be either
  true or false--the values that can be contained by the checkbox control.
  So, if we wish our governed controls to be active when the checkbox is
  "true", we would simply return the value passed to us:

    . . .
    toggleOn: value
    {
        return(value);
    }
    . . .

  However, if our "state" control were, for instance, a choice, we
  might want to activate our governed controls only when choice #2
  was selected:

        c0 = ctlchoice("Test",2,@"X","Y","Z"@);
        c1 = ctlcheckbox("Testing Number 1",true);
        c2 = ctlinteger("Disperal Range",x);
        . . .
        ctlactive(c0,"on2",c1,c2);
    . . .
    on2: value
    {
        return(value == 2);
    }

  "State" controls can be associated with up to ten (10) callback functions.
  This can allow you to perform more specific activations on controls.  For
  instance, the following code snippet will activate control 'c1' when the
  controller's integer value is greater than 10, and will activate control
  'c2' when the controller's integer value is less than, or equal to, 10:

        . . .
        x = 15;
        c0 = ctlinteger("Disperal Range",x);
        c1 = ctlcheckbox("Testing Number 1",true);
        c2 = ctlchoice("Test",2,@"X","Y","Z"@);
        . . .
        ctlactive(c0,"over10",c1);
        ctlactive(c0,"under10",c2);
    . . .
    over10: value
    {
        return(value > 10);     // turns 'c1' on or off
    }

    under10: value
    {
        return(value <= 10);    // turns 'c2' on or off
    }

  Unlike ctlgroup(), "state" controllers CANNOT be cascaded--i.e.,
  you cannot include a "state" identifier in the governed parameter
  list for another.

  Layout LScript has a new function called effectedby().  This function is
  used to inform Layout about the objects in the current scene to which
  your script has dependencies.  This function is LScript's interface to the
  plug-in API's useItems system.

  effectedby() can be called at anytime in your script, and accepts one or
  more character strings that represent the names of objects in the current
  scene whose parameters effect the script.  These names can also be
  passed to effectedby() through an array reference.

  This function has no actual impact on the execution of your script.
  Rather, it has impact on *when* your script is executed.  Layout will use
  the information provided by effectedby() to determine when your script
  (i.e., the LScript plug-in) should be executed in response to some change
  in the indicated objects.

    obj;

    create
    {
        obj = getfirstitem("MasterNull");

        // make sure process() is called
        // whenever "MasterNull" changes

        ma.set(ROTATION,v);

        v = obj.param(SCALING,time);
        ma.set(SCALING,v);
    }

  The effectedby() function can also be called in your options() function
  in response to some change to the operation of the script made by the
  user.  For instance, you can allow the user to specify which object(s)
  will effect the script:

    obj;

    process: ma, frame, time

    }

    showInteger: value

  A pleasing and professional-looking effect can be achieved by *stacking*
  controls that are conditionally visible, allowing them all to occupy the
  same location/space on the panel. In this way, the control itself appears
  to alter each time the condition changes:

        . . .
        c0 = ctlchoice("Test",2,@"X","Y","Z"@);
        c1 = ctlinteger("Disperal Range",x);
        c2 = ctlcheckbox("Testing Number 1",true);
        c3 = ctlpopup("How 'bout a pop-up?",2,@"Item 1","Item 2","Item 3"@);

        ctlvisible(c0,"vis1",c1);
        ctlvisible(c0,"vis2",c2);
        ctlvisible(c0,"vis3",c3);

        ctlposition(c0,10,10);

        // stack visiblity-controlled controls atop each other
        ctlposition(c1,0,30);
        ctlposition(c2,0,30);
        ctlposition(c3,0,30);
    . . .
    vis1: value
    { return(value == 1); }

    vis2: value
    { return(value == 2); }

    vis3: value
    { return(value == 3); }

  The internal LScript memory manager now performs full-scale garbage
  collection of unused or temporary memory.  In previous releases of
  LScript, only character strings were reclaimed by the memory manager
  as a script executed.  Now, all LScript data types are reclaimed,
  preventing long-running scripts from consuming memory unnecessarily.
  This reclamation process has added overhead to the basic execution
  of LScript, which will unavoidably translate into longer execution
  times for all scripts.

  ctlalign() allows controls to be aligned with a master control using

  A requester function called ctlrefresh() is available to make indicated
  controls act as triggers to "refresh" the values of other controls on the
  panel.  The function takes a control identifier, and the name of a refresh
  callback function.  When the specified control is altered in any way by
  the user (i.e., mouse clicks, keyboard entry, etc.), the refresh callback
  is invoked with the current value of the control.

  Unlike callbacks used by other requester controls, the callback for
  ctlrefresh() should not return a value.  Instead, control refreshing
  takes place through the use of the setvalue() function.

    filenames;
    counter = 2;
    c1;

    main
    {
        . . .
        filenames = matchfiles("c:\\temp","*.*");

        c0 = ctlchoice("Test",counter,@"X","Y","Z"@);

        . . .
    }

    refresh: value
    {
        setvalue(c1,filenames[value]);
    }

  Note the use of the global values.  Because the refresh callback alters
  the values of controls directly, the control identifiers must be visible
  at a global level.  For instance, in the example above, the 'c1' variable
  is made global so that the refresh callback can change its value directly.

  Point and Polygon data types have been given their own set of data members
  and methods.  In each case, additional information is available through
  these additions that cannot be accessed by any other means in LScript.

  The Point data type now responds to the following messages:

      polygon/polygon()

              this element of the Point data type is overloaded to return
              different data based on the context.  if the element is
              accessed directly, then the number of polygons to which the
              point belongs is returned.  if the method context is invoked,
              then one or more polygon identifiers will be returned to
              the caller.  if the point is unassociated with any polygon,
              the data member context will return zero (0), and the method
              context will return 'nil'.

              the data member context is read-only.

      x, y, z

              these three data members hold the position of the point
              along the indicated axis.  these values can be read, or
              the can be assigned to.  assignments will alter the
              position of the point.

  The Polygon data type now responds to the following messages:

      surface

              this is the surface name currently assigned to the polygon.
              this data member can be read, and it can be assigned to.
              if the surface name assigned does not exist, LScript will
              first create it.

      pointCount

              an integer value that contains the number of points that
              comprise the polygon.  this data member is read-only.

      layer

              an integer value between 1 and 10 that indicates the
              Modeler layer in which the polygon lives.  this data
              member is read-only.

      points[]

              an array of Point identifiers that contain all the points
              that comprise the polygon.  it has 'pointCount' elements.
              the elements in this data member are read-only.

      isCurve()

              returns a true or false value that indicates whether
              the polygon is a curve (true) or a face (false).

      hasCCEnd()

              if the polygon is a curve, this method will return
              true if it contains a control point at its tail.

      hasCCStart()

              if the polygon is a curve, this method will return
              true if it contains a control point at its head.

      setPoints()

              this method can be used to set the points that
              comprise the polygon.  it accepts an array reference
              containing pre-existing point ids, a list of
              pre-existing pointer ids, or a series of one or
              more vector values that the method will first
              convert into points and then apply them to the
              polygon.

  Point and Polygon messages are only legal during a mesh edit
  session (i.e., between calls to editBegin() and editEnd()).

  The LScript pre-processor now understands a simple form of conditional
  code compilation.  Using the new @if, @else, and @end directives, you
  can instruct the compiler to include--or exclude--code from compilation.

  The @if test expects an identifer, followed by an optional equality
  operator, and an optional value to test.  If the optional value is
  omitted, then the test will succeed if the identifer exists in either
  the pre-processor's macro list, or in the LScript environment
  (enviromental testing is not performed on the Mac).
  
    . . .
    @if LOCALMODE
        info("running in local mode");
    @end
    . . .

  If the test value exists without an equality operator, then equality
  is tested by default.  Recognized equality test operators are "<", ">",
  "<=", ">=", "==", and "!=".

    . . .
    @define TEST 45
    . . .
    @if TEST > 40
        info("TEST > 40");
    @else
        info("TEST <= 40");
    @end
    . . .

  A special identifier "version" is recognized that will evaluate to
  the current version of the LScript plug-in.  This allows code to be
  compiled based upon the version of LScript.

    . . .
    @if version < 1.4
        scl = degree(obj.getScale(time));
    @else
        scl = obj.getScale(time);
    @end
    . . .

  In addition, a "not" operator can be applied to any test to invert the
  result.

    . . .
    @if not version 1.4
        scl = degree(obj.getScale(time));
    @else
        scl = obj.getScale(time);
