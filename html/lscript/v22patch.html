  The Channel Requester control (ctlchannel()) was totally whacked.  In the conversion
  from Panels, it was not duplicated as anything remotely resembling the Panels
  implementation.  To a large extent, this has been corrected.

  As part of this correction, an <u>event</u> callback function has been enabled for the
  control.  To avoid breaking existing scripts, this callback declaration now appears
  as the fifth parameter to the ctlchannel() function, and is optional.  Whenever a
  channel is selected, the <u>event</u> function will be called with the selected Channel
  Object Agent as the sole argument:

    generic
    {
        reqbegin("Testing");
        c1 = ctlchannel("Channels",200,200,,"chan_sel");
        reqpost();
        ...
    }

    chan_sel: channel
    {
        info(channel.keyExists(0.0) ? "Yes" : "No");
    }

  As with the Listbox control, the width and height paramaters (200 and 200 in the
  above example) are in terms of pixels.

  As with the Listbox control, Channel trees also respond to the requpdate() call.

  Crashing could occur when a Requester panel was opened, closed, and then
  immediately re-opened.  This has been corrected.

  The internal code to locate a specific object's Channel Group was not recursive,
  causing search results to include only the shallow components.  Object's whose
  channels were subordinate to other objects (like Bones) were not being located
  as a result.

  The run-time system was not managing short numeric types when a need existed to
  swap bytes--such as when running an Intel-compiled script on the Macintosh.  This
  lead to some odd error messages and occasional crashes.
