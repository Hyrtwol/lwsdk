  A Layout object's world rotation values can now be calculated using the new <b>WROTATION</b>
  param() method flag, or the new <b>getWorldRotation()</b> method.  If the object is unparented,
  then <b>WROTATION</b>/<b>getWorldRotation()</b> returns a value equivalent to <b>ROTATION</b>/<b>getRotation()</b>.

  A new control type called <b>ctlmenu()</b> has been added to the Requester mechanism.  This
  control type consists of a button that displays a popup menu when pressed.

  The first argument is the title of the button.  Next, a list of the items that will
  appear on the menu when displayed.  As with <b>ctlpopup()</b>, this list can be an array
  reference or an initialization block of values.  A required callback function is then
  defined to process any selections made from the menu.  A fourth optional argument will
  define a callback used to enable/disable individual menu entries.

  A special entry value is recognized as a menu separator.  An entry that begins with
  at least two equal signs (=) will cause a separator to be added to the popup menu
  at the indicated location.

  The menu value returned to either callback function corresponds directly to the linear
  value of the entry in the original items.  However, separator entries will never be
  processed.

  Two new Requester functions, <b>drawtextwidth()</b> and <b>drawtextheight()</b>, have been added to
  determine the display width and height, in pixels, of a text string.  They each take
  a single character string, and return an integer value representing this pixel width
  or height.

  A new information display control is available to Requesters.  Created with <b>ctlinfo()</b>,
  it defines an area on the Requester panel into which subsequent drawing will occur
  when a specified UDF callback is invoked.  All drawing into this area is clipped by
  LScript.

  Three arguments are required by the <b>ctlinfo()</b> function.  The first two are integer values
  that specify the width and height of the display area.  The third argument defines
  the UDF to be called when the informational area needs to be redrawn.  This UDF takes
  no arguments, and has access to all the Requester redraw functions (<b>drawtext()</b>,
  <b>drawpixel()</b>, etc.).

  Layout Object Agents now provide methods for managing each object's scene tag information.

  The <b>getTag()</b> method takes an integer index value, and returns the tag value for that index,
  or 'nil' is no tag exists.

  The <b>setTag()</b> method take an index value, and a string tag value, and applies it to the
  object.  When the current scene is saved, the tag information will be stored into the
  scene file in association with the object.
