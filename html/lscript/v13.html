  Added new requester functions:

     reqsize(width,height)

        allows you to set the width and height of the requester panel.  this
        function gives you manual control.

     ctlposition(ctlid,column,row)

        positions a control at the indicated column/row coordinates on the
        requester panel.  once you call this function, LScript relinquishes
        all control on the formatting of your controls. once you call it, you
        must call it for ALL controls on the requester or they will all
        default to (0,0) and stack one upon another.

     ctlpopup(title,default,choices[])

        creates a pop-up control with the values provided.  a pop-up is a
        button-like control that displays a scrolling list of values when it
        is selected with the mouse.

     ctlslider(title,default,minimum,maximum)

        creates a scroll-bar slider whose range matches that provided, and
        includes a numeric input field.

     ctlminislider(title,default,minimum,maximum)

        creates a numeric input field with a scroll button to the immediate
        right.

     ctlsep([column,width])

        this draw a 3D separator horizontally across your requester panel.
        'column' is the starting column (pixel) of the separator, and 'width'
        is number of columns (pixels) of the separator.  if no parameters are
        provided, then the separator will span the entire width of your panel.
        a 'width' of -1 will draw the separator to the right-most limit of
        your panel.

  Function call parameter and associative assignment lists can now have
  implicit 'nil' elements.  If a position in a parameter or assignment
  list is left empty (i.e., nothing in that position), then that
  position receives an implicit 'nil' setting.

  Consider the following function call parameter example:

      main
      {
          testudf(,"Bob",,15.0,);
      }

      testudf: p1,p2,p3,p4,p5
      {
          info(p1," ",p2," ",p3," ",p4," ",p5);
      }

  This example script would print:

      (nil) Bob (nil) 15 (nil)

  Associative assignments benefit too from this new feature.  Let's
  say you needed only the 3rd, 4th, and 6th elements of a multi-element
  return value:

      main
      {
          str = "23,-45,69.6,100,-.05,15.34";

          (,,p1,p2,,p3) = parse(",",str);

          info(p1," ",p2," ",p3);
      }

  This example script would print:

      69.6 100 15.34

  Please note that implicit 'nil' only works with function call
  parameter lists and associative assignment lists, and only when
  commas (,) are employed.  Leaving an empty parameter entry in
  any other part of the system will likely generate a
  compile-time error.

  Default value assignments can now be made on function argument
  parameters (much like C++).  These default value assignments
  will trigger if the value passed to the function in that
  position is 'nil'.

  Consider the following example:

      main
      {
          testudf(,"Bob",,15.0,);
      }

      testudf: p1 = -3.4,p2,p3 = "pretty",p4,p5
      {
          info(p1," ",p2," ",p3," ",p4," ",p5);
      }

  This example script would print:

      -3.4 Bob pretty 15 (nil)

  If you wish to provide for an actual 'nil' value in your
  function's processing, then you must either avoid using default
  value assignments for that parameter, or use 'nil' as the
  default value.

      main
      {
          testudf(,"Bob",,15.0,);
      }

      testudf: p1,p2,p3 = "pretty",p4,p5
      {
          if(p1)    // if 'p1' == nil, nothing will print
              info(p1," ",p2," ",p3," ",p4," ",p5);

  Equality testing in the engine has been enhanced to allow for more
  dissimilar type comparisons.  When comparisons take place ('==', '<', etc.),
  the second comparitor is converted to be of an equivalent data type as that
  of the first (if it is not already).

            anumber = 1.5;
            astring = "43.34";

            if(anumber == astring)  // 'astring' is converted into
            {                       // a number for the comparison
                ...

            if(astring == anumber)  // 'anumber' is converted into
            {                       // a string for the comparison

  Be aware that, in some less conventional comparisons, you may get results
  that differ depending upon which comparitor appears first.  In cases where
  the comparitors are too dissimilar, the results are undefined.

  The run-time system has undergone a minor overhaul.  The binary format of
  compiled scripts now mimics the Interchange File Format (IFF) used by
  LightWave Object files.  This format provides enhanced modularity, and
  will enable the run-time system to be more tolerant of additions to the
  file (meaning re-compiles will become less necessary) in future releases.
  Experimental features have also been added to aid script writers in the
  commercial and semi-commerical distribution of their work.

  Because the file format has change significantly, existing compiled
  scripts will not work with v1.3 of LScript without being re-compiled.
  However, unlike predecessors, v1.3 of the run-time system should now
  be able to detect older binary file version and display an appropriate
  error message (typically "Bad magic value...") instead of crashing.

  With regard to external script components, LScript is now somewhat more
  self-configuring.  When an external component is encountered in a script
  (whether during execution or compiling) that cannot be located through
  available resources, LScript will prompt the user to locate the component
  themselves.  Once successfully located, LScript will update its own internal
  search system so that, while the located component does not move, LScript
  will not have to prompt for its location again.  External components
  upon which scripts can be dependent are things like insert files and Object
  Agent Libraries.

                       - integer and number, returns the the value itself
                       - string, returns the number of characters
                       - vector, returns 1
                       - array, returns the total elements allocated

      count()       returns the count of the item

                       - string, returns the number of characters
                       - array, returns the number of elements that
                         contain values

      asInt()       returns the data interpreted as an integer
      asNum()       returns the data interpreted as a number
      asStr()       returns the data interpreted as a character string
      asVec()       returns the data interpreted as a vector

      pack()        packs the data
                       - returns a boolean true or false to indicate
                         whether or not packing took place
                       - integer, number and vector, does nothing

                       - array, packs elements with values down to
                         remove intervening 'nil' values

      trunc()       truncates the data
                       - returns a boolean true or false to indicate
                         whether or not truncating took place
                       - integer, number and vector, does nothing

                         elements whose value is 'nil'

      sortA()       sorts the data
                       - returns a boolean true or false to indicate
                         whether or not sorting took place
                       - integer, number and vector, does nothing

                       - array, packs, then sorts like elements in
                         ascending order.  integer, number and string
                         are sortable.

      sortD()       sorts the data
                       - returns a boolean true or false to indicate
                         whether or not sorting took place
                       - integer, number and vector, does nothing

                       - array, packs, then sorts like elements in
                         descending order.  integer, number and string
                         are sortable.

      isNil()       tests the data type for 'nil'
                       - returns a boolean true or false
                       - functionally equivalent to performing
                         and equality test (i.e., "data == nil")

      isInt()       tests the data type for integer
                       - returns a boolean true or false
                       - there is no equality test equivalent

      isNum()       tests the data type for number
                       - returns a boolean true or false
                       - there is no equality test equivalent

      isStr()       tests the data type for string
                       - returns a boolean true or false
                       - there is no equality test equivalent

                       - returns a boolean true or false
                       - there is no equality test equivalent

  The following code fragment creates an array of 8 elements, and
  then places values within it at random.  A pack() and a trunc()
  are then performed on the array:

      q[8] = nil;
      q[2] = 1.5; q[4] = "Bob"; q[5] = <1,2,3>;

      info(q.size());
      info(q.count());
      info(q);

      q.pack();

      info(q);

      q.trunc();

      info(q);

  This script code would print the following messages:

      8

      3

      (nil) 1.5 (nil) "Bob" <1,2,3> (nil) (nil) (nil)

      1.5 "Bob" <1,2,3> (nil) (nil) (nil) (nil) (nil)

      1.5 "Bob" <1,2,3>

  While all data types respond to each message, not all operations have
  meaning.  For instance, packing or truncating an integer does nothing.
