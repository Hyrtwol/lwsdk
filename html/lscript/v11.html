    Release versioning of the scripting engine will no longer depend upon the build
    increment to identify minor revisions.  This mechanism renders the "version"
    pragma directive virtually unusable as it is not designed to regard point
    build information.  Henceforth, while the build increment may be used
    internally, the minor designator (and, when appropriate, the major designator)
    will be incremented for each release to once again enable accurate versioning
    within scripts.  Point build increment information will only be displayed in
    test releases.

    The Object Agent Interface has been altered slightly and is now versioned
    to prevent Object Agent libraries from being loaded that do not support the
    current interface specifications.  <A HREF="Appendix_B.html">Appendix B</A> of the LScript documentation
    has been updated to reflect these changes and to document the versioning
    mechanism.

    A new inline selection mechanism has been added to the language syntax.
    An "inline index" is now available for use that allows you to select an
    item from a list of values based upon an expression that must evaluate
    to an integer index value.

    The syntax of the inline index is quite similar to that of the inline
    selection mechanism.  Whereas inline selection utilizes the "?:" token
    pair to perform boolean (true/false) selection:

            pinfo[count][WOBBLEMAG] = wobble ? 30 : 10;

    The inline index uses the "?" operator to perform its indexing selection:

            pinfo[count][WOBBLEMAG] = wobble ? @30,15,10@;

    If the index value is less than 1 or greater than the highest offset of
    the list of values provided, then a 'nil' value will be returned.

    Any data type capable of being indexed can be used on the right side of
    the "?" operator, while any expression that evaluates to an integer index
    value can be used on the left:

            str = "This is my string";
            x = selectChar() ? str; // if selectChar() returns 6, x becomes "i"

            which = 1 ? 15;   // 'which' becomes 15
            which = 3 ? 15;   // 'which' becomes 'nil'

            mySel = offset[5] ? @1,2,3,4,5,6,7@;
            mySel = offset[5] ? offset; // use element #5 value to select
                                        // another element!

    The Modeler Layer functions (getempty(), getemptyfg(), getemptybg(), etc.)
    have been altered to return a single 'nil' value instead of an array of
    'nil' values if conditions warrant.  This is intended to cut down on memory
    consumption by not creating an array, and to speed up the function calls
    themselves.

                  bg = getempty()

                  if(bg[1] == nil)      // no longer valid

                  if(bg == nil)         // now, the correct way to check

    Under Intel platforms, the configuration system has been enhanced to first
    check for registry key values in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\NewTek\\LScript
    global registry entry before going to the plug-in specific entry below it.
    This allows for values to be established that can apply to ALL classes of
    LScript plug-in, instead of having to duplicate entries across all registry
    entries.

    For instance, I personally place my LibraryPath key setting into this
    registry entry so that all LScript plug-ins (both Modeler and Layout) look
    in the same location(s) for insert files and shared libraries.

    (When the Visual C++ compiler is updated by Microsoft beyond v4.0 on the
    DEC Alpha platform, this mechanism will also work for that platform.  To
    date, the Visual C++ compiler for DEC Alpha does not even give software
    developers access to the registry because of its age.)

    The IPC mechanism has been enhanced to support array queue members.
    These new member types are declared and accessed just as any local
    LScript array:

        @insert "/lights.inc"
        ...
        // 'TOTALLIGHTS' defined as 200 in "lights.inc"
        expose light[TOTALLIGHTS] as LightQueue;
        ...
            for(x = 1;x <= TOTALLIGHTS;x++)
                light[x] = <0,0,0>;

    As each array element consumes a queue slot entry, there is a practical
    limit to the size of the array, dictated by the resources available in
    your operating system.
