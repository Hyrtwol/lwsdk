  A new Mesh Object Agent data member has been added, called "flags".  This data member is an
  array of five elements.  The first three duplicate the values found in the <b>shadows[]</b> data
  member.  The remaining two, <b>flags[4]</b> and <b>flags[5]</b>, indicate the object's current
  "Unseen By Camera" and "Unseeen By Rays" settings.

  This new data member is intended to replace the existing <b>shadows[]</b> data member.  You should
  begin using this data member in future scripts as the <b>shadows[]</b> data memeber will eventually
  be removed from the Object Agent.

  A series of new identification methods have been added to the Object Agent class.
  These methods return a boolean true/false indicating the type of the object for
  which the Object Agent is a proxy.

        isLight()
        isCamera()

  The Image Object Agent now includes two new methods, <b>alpha()</b> and <b>alphaSpot()</b>, and a new data
  member called <b>hasAlpha</b>, for accessing Alpha-channel image data.

  The <b>hasAlpha</b> data member is a Boolean flag that indicates whether or not the image contains any
  Alpha image data.  If this flag is true, then the Alpha data can be accessed using the new methods.

  The new <b>alpha()</b> method functions just like the Image Object Agent <b>rgb()</b> method.  Given an (x,y)
  position within the image, the Alpha value for that pixel will be returned.  Alpha-channel data
  contains only one numeric value for each triplet RGB value.

  <b>alphaSpot()</b> functions just like <b>rgbSpot()</b>, with the exception that it only returns a single
  numeric value.

  The <b>reqabort()</b> function has been added to the Requester system.  This function is intended to be
  called from within a control or requester callback function, and will immediately terminate the
  posted requester.  No user intervention is required.

  When <b>reqabort()</b> is called without arguments, a "Cancel" result is returned to the <b>reqpost()</b> function.
  This simulates a user press of that button.  If a <b>true</b> value is provided to <b>reqabort()</b>, then an "Ok"
  result is passed to <b>reqpost()</b>.

        generic
        {
            reqbegin("Reqabort() Test");

            reqsize(200,180);

  The ctlposition() function now accepts three additional, optional numeric arguments.  These
  new arguments provide access to sizeable requester controls in LScript.

  The third argument indicates the width (in pixels) of the control.  The fourth indicates the
  height (also in pixels) of the control.

  The fifth indicates the offset value for the control.  An offset value can be used to control
  the width of the label field for controls that have labels, or the distance a control is
  shifted to the right from its left-most position for those without labels.

  New selection types have been added to the Modeler selpolygon() function.  You can now select
  <b>BONE</b>, <b>PATCH</b>, and <b>MBALL</b> elements within the mesh.

  <b>BONE</b> is a synonym for Skelegon, and you can in fact also specify <b>SKELEGON</b>.

  <b>MBALL</b> stands for Metaball.

  These selection types are without argument, and will select all elements of that type within
  the current mesh.

  A new Light Object Agent data member has been added, called "flags".  This data member is an
  array of six elements, each corresponding to the flag values returned by the SDK function.  More
  specifically, each element provides the following information about the Light:

        flags[1]        <b>true</b> if <b>Limited Range</b> is enabled
        flags[2]        <b>true</b> if <b>Affect Diffuse</b> is enabled

    <b>REFLECTGREEN</b>     Green levels of the contribution from mirror reflections
    <b>REFLECTBLUE</b>      Blue levels of the contribution from mirror reflections

  All new buffers are floating point, and must be accessed using the floatline()
  IF function.

  The Scene Object Agent has a new method called <b>getSelect()</b>.  This method returns, as a list
  of Object Agents, all the items in a scene that are currently selected.  Called without arguments,
  all selected items--whether Mesh, Bone, Light, or Camera--will be returned.  A flag value can be
  specified to limit the view of selections to a particular genus.  Flags can be MESH, BONE, LIGHT,
  or CAMERA.

  This method is intended to simplfy the process of determining selected items, although the
  <b>firstSelect()</b> and <b>nextSelect()</b> methods are still available for special processing needs.

    <b>fogMinDist</b>(time)                This method returns the distance from the viewer (typically

    <b>fogMaxDist</b>(time)                This method returns the distance at which the fog effect

    <b>fogMinAmount</b>(time)              Returns the minimum amount of fog (the amount at the minimum
                                    distance). Fog amounts range from 0.0 to 1.0. 

    <b>fogMaxAmount</b>(time)              Returns the maximum amount of fog (the amount at the maximum
                                    distance).

    <b>fogColor</b>(time)                  This method returns, as a vector, the color of the fog at the

  Binary data can now be embedded directly within an LScript.  This data is handled by
  LScript as nothing more than a stream of unsigned bytes.  This allows any type of
  binary data to be embedded within the script and accessed at run-time.

  Binary data is delimited between a pair of preprocessor directives, "@data"
  and "@end".  Individual bytes are declared as integer values between 0 and 255.
  The data can be of any length on each line, but you should probably keep them
  under 80 columns for readibility and maximum editor compatibility.

  Each block of binary data must be named.  The name provided will become a global
  variable within the operating environment of the script when it begins to execute.

        @data bobdata
        070 079 082 077 000 000 039 064 076 087 079 050 084 065 071 083 000 000 000 010
        069 121 101 000 073 114 105 115 000 000 076 065 089 082 000 000 000 018 000 000
        ...
        @end

  The binary block identifiers exist at run-time just like any other global variable
  in your script.  They can be queried as Objects:

        info(bobdata.size());

  They can be used with the foreach() iterator:

        foreach(x,bobdata)
        {
            ...
        }

  They can be passed to functions:

        info(blocksize(bobdata));

        blocksize: data
        {
            return(data.size());
        }

  Their data can be accessed and modified as the script executes:

        x = bobdata[25];
        bobdata[25] = 0;

  As a side note, not only will your script sizes be considerably smaller, but parsing
  of the binary data will go slightly faster if values are included as a bare minimum.
  For instance, "0" will parse faster than "000", and consume two less bytes in the disc
  file.  The bytes in the examples above have been padded only for visual alignment, not
  out of any necessity.

  You can use <a href=GenData.ls>this</a> Generic script to generate syntactically correct LScript binary
  data from any disc file.  It will generate code to a new file, or you can specify
  an existing file (i.e., script) to which the generated code will be appended.

  A new File Object Agent method has been added specifically to handle block binary
  data.  Using writeData(), you can send the binary data in a block to a disc file.
  This can be used to re-create binary files from the embedded binary data within
  the script.  For instance, a LightWave object file can be embedded in a script
  and carried along with the script until needed:

        @version 2.2
        @warnings

  which entries in the control can be selected by the user.  The <u>select</u> callback function
  should take an integer argument that represents the index of the element being selected,

  Listbox controls in LScript are now always multiple-select.  In order to accomodate this,
  certain value changes have been made.

  The argument provided to the "event" function for listbox controls is now either an array
  of indices denoting the current selection(s) in the listbox, or 'nil' if no selections exist.

  The getvalue() return type for listbox controls has become multi-element, with each
  element denoting the index of the selected item.  If no items are selected in the listbox
  when getvalue() is called, then 'nil' is returned.

  The setvalue() function can now accept a number of different data types for setting the
  selection within a listbox.

  Here is a sample script to illustrates the new listbox interface mechanism:

    @version 2.2
    @warnings

    c1;
    lb_items;

    generic
    {
        for(x = 1;x <= 5;x++)
           lb_items += "Item_" + x;

        reqbegin("Testing List Box");

        c1 = ctllistbox("Items",300,300,"lb_count","lb_name","lb_event");
        c2 = ctlbutton("Select",50,"button_event");

        return if !reqpost();

        sel = getvalue(c1);

        reqend();

        if(sel == nil)
            info("No selections were made");
        else
            info("You have selected '",sel,"'!");
    }

    lb_count
    {
        return(lb_items.size());
    }

    lb_name: index
    {
        return(lb_items[index]);
    }

    lb_event: items
    {
        // 'items' is an array of integer index values,
        // or 'nil'

        if(items == nil)
            info("No items are selected");
        else
            info("You have selected '",items,"'!");
    }

    button_event
    {
    //    a = @"Item_2","Item_4"@;
        a = @1,3,5@;
    //    a = 4;
    //    a = "Item_5";

        setvalue(c1,a);
    }

  LScript is no longer using the Panels sub-system to generate requesters, but rather is
  now using the LightWave toolkit directly.  This has lead to a change in the
  interpretation of the listbox height value.

  The listbox control used to specify widths in pixels and heights in number of listbox
  entries that should be visible.  However, the height for a listbox now also specifies
  pixels.  Taking the example script provided in the v2.1 release notes, the following
  would produce a listbox that is 300-pixels wide and 10-pixels high in v2.2:
                                                                                                        
    c1 = ctllistbox("Items",300,10,"lb_count","lb_name","lb_event");

  This will need to be updated for use with v2.2:

    c1 = ctllistbox("Items",300,300,"lb_count","lb_name","lb_event");

  The compression algorithm used by the LScript run-time system did not function properly
  when compiled file sizes exeeded some threshold.  For this reason, it has been replaced
  with a newer binary-based compression algorithm that functions similarly, achieves
  equitable ratios, and does not appear to be effected by the size of the file.

  The original compression algorithm remains in LScript to support decompression of older
  compiled scripts.

  The LightColor() and AmbientColor() Command Sequence functions now expect their arguments
  to be in floating-point format, expressed as 0.0 to indicate 0 and 1.0 to indicated 255.
  You can continue to use integer values between 0 and 255 for individual color components,
  but they must be converted to their floating-point equivalents in the range of 0.0 to
  1.0--i.e., (150 / 255.0)
