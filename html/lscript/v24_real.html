  A Layout object's world rotation values can now be calculated using the new <b>WROTATION</b>
  param() method flag, or the new <b>getWorldRotation()</b> method.  If the object is unparented,
  then <b>WROTATION</b>/<b>getWorldRotation()</b> returns a value equivalent to <b>ROTATION</b>/<b>getRotation()</b>.

  A new control type called <b>ctlmenu()</b> has been added to the Requester mechanism.  This
  control type consists of a button that displays a popup menu when pressed.

  The first argument is the title of the button.  Next, a list of the items that will
  appear on the menu when displayed.  As with <b>ctlpopup()</b>, this list can be an array
  reference or an initialization block of values.  A required callback function is then
  defined to process any selections made from the menu.  A fourth optional argument will
  define a callback used to enable/disable individual menu entries.

  A special entry value is recognized as a menu separator.  An entry that begins with
  at least two equal signs (=) will cause a separator to be added to the popup menu
  at the indicated location.

  The menu value returned to either callback function corresponds directly to the linear
  value of the entry in the original items.  However, separator entries will never be
  processed.

  A new information display control is available to Requesters.  Created with <b>ctlinfo()</b>,
  it defines an area on the Requester panel into which subsequent drawing will occur
  when a specified UDF callback is invoked.  All drawing into this area is clipped by
  LScript.

  Three arguments are required by the <b>ctlinfo()</b> function.  The first two are integer values
  that specify the width and height of the display area.  The third argument defines
  the UDF to be called when the informational area needs to be redrawn.  This UDF takes
  no arguments, and has access to all the Requester redraw functions (<b>drawtext()</b>,
  <b>drawpixel()</b>, etc.).

  Several new surface-related Object Agents are available in LScript, the first of which
  is the <b>Surface</b> Object Agent, from which all others are derived.  The <b>Surface()</b> constructor
  can be used to generate an Object Agent for an existing surface, or it can be used to
  create a new surface for an object.

  The constructor can be called with no arguments, and the first surface defined in the
  system will be returned.

  If called with an integer value, the surface in the system that corresponds to that
  index value will be returned.

  Provided a surface name, the constructor will return that surface if it is already
  defined in the system.  If it does not exist, a 'nil' value will be returned under Layout,
  and a new surface with that name will be generated for the current object under Modeler.

  Provided a Mesh Object Agent, a list of the surface names defined for that object will
  be returned.

  Under Layout, you can create a new surface for an object by providing the Mesh Object
  Agent to receive the surface as the first argument, and the name of the surface as the
  second.

  The following channel constants have been defined in LScript for use with the Surface
  Object Agent:

        <b>name</b>
                the name of the surface

  The following methods are available:

        <b>getValue(&lt;channel&gt;)</b>

                returns the specific value setting for the channel (whose type is
                defined above).

        <b>getEnvelope(&lt;channel&gt;)</b>

        <b>getTexture(&lt;channel&gt;)</b>

  A Texture Object Agent can be generated from the Surface Object Agent (using its
  <b>getTexture()</b> method).  This Object Agent provides an interface to a texture assigned
  to a specific channel in a surface.  Textures have their own settings, including one or
  more layers that accumulate to represent the visual makeup of the surface.

  The following texture constants have been defined in LScript for use with the Texture
  Object Agent:

        <b>TXTRIMAGE</b>           Image Texture type
        <b>TXTRPROCEDURE</b>       Procedural Texture type
        <b>TXTRGRADIENT</b>        Gradient Texture type

  The following methods are exported by the Object Agent:

        <b>setChannelGroup(&lt;Channel Group Object Agent&gt;)</b>

                sets the Texture's channel group using the provided Object Agent.
                Envelopes created for parameters in the Texture's layers will
                belong to this group.

        <b>getChannelGroup()</b>

                returns the Channel Group Object Agent for the Texture.

        <b>firstLayer()</b>

                returns the TextureLayer Object Agent (documented below) for the
                first layer defined in the Texture.

        <b>nextLayer(&lt;TextureLayer Object Agent&gt;)</b>

                returns the TextureLayer Object Agent that follows the
                specified TextureLayer for the Texture.

        <b>addLayer(&lt;layer type&gt;)</b>

                creates a new layer in the Texture of the specific type--one,
                of <b>TXTRIMAGE</b>, <b>TXTRPROCEDURE</b> or <b>TXTRGRADIENT</b>--and returns the
                TextureLayer Object Agent for it.

  Layout Object Agents now provide methods for managing each object's scene tag information.

  The <b>getTag()</b> method takes an integer index value, and returns the tag value for that index,

  The <b>setTag()</b> method take an index value, and a string tag value, and applies it to the

  A memory leak existed in the code that processes the <b>points[]</b> Object Agent data
  member reference.  The leak did not involve memory allocated by LScript, and so
  was not released when the script terminated.

  The LScript pre-processor was unaware of the fact that the script it was processing
  was simply being installed instead of executed.  This made the pre-processor enforce
  certain pragma directives at inappropriate times.

  The Layout LScript compiler was not setting an internal architecture flag before
  compiling the specified script, leading to a loss of architecture-specific constant
  definitions in the output file.  This lack of definition caused operational
  anomalies with the Layout LScript run-time system.
