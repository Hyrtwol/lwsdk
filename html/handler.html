			<H3>Handlers</H3>
			<P>Formally, handlers are plug-in classes that manage persistent
			instance data through callbacks identified in the activation
			function. Handlers don't simply run and exit. They tell LightWave&reg;
			in their activation functions where they can be reached, and then
			they hang around, waiting for LightWave&reg; to call them.</P>
			<P><STRONG>Instance Functions</STRONG></P>
			<P>An <EM>instance</EM> is a block of data you create to describe
			a specific invocation of your handler plug-in. An
			<A HREF="classes/itemmot.html">ItemMotionHandler</A>, for example,
			can be invoked for any number of items in the scene, and might
			even be invoked more than once for a given item, but for each slot
			it occupies, the plug-in will create and use an instance
			specifically for that item slot. The instance data is where the
			plug-in settings for that invocation are stored, and every one of
			the plug-in's callbacks receives this data as one of its
			arguments.</P>
			<P>The instance callbacks are where your plug-in creates,
			destroys, copies, loads, saves and describes each instance data
			block. They're collected together in an LWInstanceFuncs structure
			which is part of the local data passed to your activation
			function. Your activation function needs to fill in this structure
			to tell LightWave&reg; where your instance callbacks are.</P>
			<PRE>   typedef struct st_LWInstanceFuncs {
      void         *priv;
      LWInstance   (*create)  (void *priv, void *context, LWError *);

				<TT><BR>instance = <STRONG>create</STRONG>( priv, context, error

				</DT><DD>
				Create an instance. Called, for example, when the user selects
				your plug-in on the interface and when Layout loads a scene or an
				object file that refers to your plug-in. Typically, you'll use
				<TT>malloc</TT> to allocate memory for a data structure, fill in
				some of the structure's fields with default values, and return
				the pointer to this structure. <TT>priv</TT> is the same as the
				<TT>priv</TT> field of the LWInstanceFuncs structure and contains
				whatever your activation function put there. The <TT>context</TT>
				varies depending on the plug-in class, but this is often an item
				ID for the item this instance will be associated with. If you
				can't create an instance, set <TT>error</TT> to an error message
				string and return NULL. 
				</DD><DT>
				<TT><BR><STRONG>destroy</STRONG>( instance )</TT> 
				</DT><DD>
				Destroy an instance. Called, for example, when the user deselects

				existence of this callback is optional.   When not provided, the
				save callback must set to NULL.  Doing so prevent saving the
				plugin's data.  Upon loading, the existence of the plugin will
				not exist in this sitiation and it will not get instanced.  This
				is useful for Master Class handlers that are meant to be LAYOUT
				types (they survive a scene clear).  Saved scenes would not
				contain the plugin; and therefore, loading the scene would not
				create a duplicate instance of it.  Another use is for
				save-disabling a demonstration version of a plugin.</DD><DT>

<dl>
<dt><strong><tt>done</tt></strong></dt><dd>Gizmos use the plugin instance data, and are therefore destroyed when the plugin instance is destroyed.</dd>
<dt><strong><tt>event</tt></strong></dt><dd>Gizmos are non-modal and can not be dropped or activated independent of the plugin.</dd>
<dt><strong><tt>panel</tt></strong></dt><dd>Use the plugin interface class instead.</dd>
</dl>
			From version 2 of the gizmo interface the drawing done by a gizmo can participate
                        in viewport picking by supplying a <tt><b>pickItems</b></tt> function. In version 3
			this was expanded to include an array of part numbers:
<dl>
<dt><tt>items = <b>pickItems</b>( instance, drawitems, drawparts )</tt></dt>
<dd>
The <tt>drawitems</tt> array contains the item IDs that were set with <tt><b>setCSysItem</b></tt>
(see below) for those parts of the gizmo drawing that were picked. This array may be <tt>NULL</tt>
if there were no items set, otherwise the array will be terminated with <tt>LWITEM_NULL</tt>.
The array may contain multiple item IDs (for example if the gizmo draws in multiple coordinate
systems and a box selection is done), but no duplicates.
<p>
If there are items in the array, then there can be an optional <tt>drawparts</tt> array of part
numbers supplied. If not NULL, each entry in the array corresponds with the matching entry in the <tt>drawitems</tt>
array. The values in the array are derived from the part numbers supplied by the <tt>LWCustomObjAccess</tt>
<tt><b>setPart</b></tt> function. There can be multiple part numbers per item. Each value is a bitfield of
32 bits. Part number 1 is mapped to bit 0 (least significant bit), part 2 to bit 1, and so on up to part 32
and bit 31 (most significant bit).
<p>
Return an <tt>LWITEM_NULL</tt> terminated array of items which should become selected or deselected
when the user picks the drawing done by the gizmo. It is acceptable to return <tt>NULL</tt>, which is
equivalent to no items. During the picking tests, the gizmo's draw function will be called with the
<tt>LWCOFL_PICKING</tt> flag set.
<p>
A common implementation for gizmos which add drawing to items in their coordinate systems would be
to simply return <tt>drawitems</tt>.
</dd>
</dl>
			<p>Note that a gizmo is not associated with any specific item in the scene,
			unlike a <a href="classes/custobj.html">Custom Object Handler</a> for example.
			When drawing using an object-relative coordinate system, use the
			<tt><b>setCSysItem</b></tt> <tt>LWCustomObjAccess</tt> function to set which
			item to draw relative to.
			<p>A gizmo is automatically enabled if the plugin is enabled. It is up
			to the gizmo implementation to decide whether or not to draw based on
			the state of Layout, for example by examining if a particular item is
			selected or not.
			<p>By combining a <a href="classes/master.html">Master Handler</a> with
			a gizmo, a non-modal always-on layout tool can be created.
